## FAQ

#### How to use?

- First you will install using the runelite plugin-hub.
- After installing you will configure your vengeance helper, you should be on this screen

#### First box ("Flash the Reminder Box")
- The first box works as an alert flasher, so you will see a box in the game that will flash red (if you have Photosensitive epilepsy, don't use this option).
#### Second box ("Notify when vegeance expires")
- The second box works like the runelite notification, if you don't want to just turn it off.
#### Timeout Vengeance Box
- And finally the third box works as a time limit that you can preset as you wish.
